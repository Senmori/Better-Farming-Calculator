### Getting Started

***
To get started, firstly [fork this repository](https://github.com/login?return_to=/Senmori/Better-Farming-Calculator).

It is recommended to use IntelliJ for this project because we already have the run configurations added, but you can use whatever you feel comfortable with.

Coding conventions are the same as Runelite's; which you can see [here](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Code-Conventions.).

Make sure you also have [Lombok](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Building-with-IntelliJ-IDEA#installing-lombok) installed in your IDE.

To test the program (if you do not have the run configurations), simple run the `com.bettercalculator.BetterCalculatorTest` class.
